Binding: Indicates that the compound interacts or attaches effectively to the thrombin target site.
Non-binding: Indicates that the compound does not interact effectively with thrombin.
In the context of drug discovery, thrombin is a protein that could be a target for drugs aimed at affecting blood clotting, and identifying compounds that bind to thrombin can be a critical step in developing new medications.

There are 11881 features that are all 0 for the 800 rows.

Feature selection using regularization - Shrinking the coefficients that are unimportant for predictions 
which results in some coefficients to become 0.
```{r} 
# Load necessary libraries
library(Matrix)
library(glmnet)
# Convert your features data frame to a sparse matrix for efficiency and easier computations
#Sparse matrices only store non-zero elements and their positions
sparse_data <- as(features, "sparseMatrix")


# Define your target variable (assuming the target variable is the first column in `data`)
y <- data[, 1]
```


glmnet:
Fits a generalized linear model using a regularization path (either Lasso, Ridge, or Elastic Net) for a range of lambda values.
Does not perform cross-validation; it fits the model for a specified sequence of lambda values, allowing you to examine the entire regularization path.
Useful for examining the effect of lambda on the coefficients (solution path) without determining an optimal value for lambda.
Example use case: Exploring how the coefficients vary as the regularization strength changes across different lambda values.
```{r}
# Fit a regularized logistic regression model using glmnet
# Lasso (alpha = 1), Ridge (alpha = 0), or Elastic Net (alpha = 0.5)
fit_1 <- glmnet(sparse_data, y, family = "binomial", alpha = 1)  # Lasso regularization

plot(fit_1, xvar="lambda", label= TRUE)
```


cv.glmnet:
Builds on glmnet by adding cross-validation to determine the best lambda for model performance.
Automatically performs k-fold cross-validation (default is 10-fold) to find the lambda that minimizes cross-validated error.
Provides two optimal values:
lambda.min: The value of lambda that gives the minimum cross-validation error.
lambda.1se: The largest lambda within one standard error of lambda.min, offering a more regularized (simpler) model.
Example use case: Selecting an optimal lambda value based on cross-validation.

```{r}
# Fit a regularized logistic regression model using glmnet with cross-validation
# Regularisation using either LASSO when alpha=1, RIDGE REGRESSION when alpha= 0, Mix of LASSO and RIDGE alpha= 1/2

#LASS0
cv_fit_1 <- cv.glmnet(sparse_data, y, family = "binomial", parallel = TRUE, alpha= 1)

# Display the best lambda value (regularization parameter)
best_lambda_1 <- cv_fit_1$lambda.min
print(best_lambda_1)

# To make predictions with the model
predictions_1 <- predict(cv_fit_1, sparse_data, s = "lambda.min", type = "response")

# Get the coefficients of the selected features
selected_features_1 <- coef(cv_fit_1, s = "lambda.min")

# Convert to a standard matrix to make subsetting easier
selected_features_1<- as.matrix(selected_features_1)

# Extract and print only the non-zero coefficients
selected_features_nonzero_1 <- selected_features_1[selected_features_1 != 0, ]
print(selected_features_nonzero_1)

```


```{r}
## plot of the solution path, i.e. estimated coefficients vs log (lambda), where lambda is the tuning parameter
plot(cv_fit_1, xvar="lambda", label= TRUE)
```
The dashed lines point to:
The 𝜆 with the lowest MSE
The 𝜆with MSE less than one standard deviation away from the minimum MSE.



We can do the same for the Ridge regression and the mix of Ridge and Mix regression
```{r} 
#RIDGE REGRESSION

#cv_fit_2<- cv.glmnet(sparse_data, y, family = "binomial", parallel = TRUE, alpha= 0)
#LASSO + RIDGE REGRESSION
cv_fit_3<- cv.glmnet(sparse_data, y, family = "binomial", parallel = TRUE, alpha= 1/2)


#best_lambda_2 <- cv_fit_2$lambda.min
#print(best_lambda_2)
best_lambda_3 <- cv_fit_3$lambda.min
print(best_lambda_3)

#predictions_2 <- predict(cv_fit_2, sparse_data, s = "lambda.min", type = "response")
predictions_3 <- predict(cv_fit_3, sparse_data, s = "lambda.min", type = "response")

#selected_features_2 <- coef(cv_fit_2, s = "lambda.min")
selected_features_3 <- coef(cv_fit_3, s = "lambda.min")

#selected_features_2<- as.matrix(selected_features_2)
selected_features_3<- as.matrix(selected_features_3)

#selected_features_nonzero_2 <- selected_features_2[selected_features_2 != 0, ]
# print(selected_features_nonzero_2)
selected_features_nonzero_3 <- selected_features_3[selected_features_3 != 0, ]
print(selected_features_nonzero_3)

```
```{r}
plot(cv_fit_3, xvar="lambda", label= TRUE)
```
I commented the ridge regression out of the code because it keeps all the features and just makes the coefficeints smaller while the other models actually removes features by shrinking they coefficeints to 0.


We can test on how well the 2 model perform top choose the best:
```{r}
# We can get the cross validation test error of the 3 methods to see which one performs best on our dataset:
lasso_error <- min(cv_fit_1$cvm)
#ridge_r_error <- min(cv_fit_2$cvm)
mix_error <- min(cv_fit_3$cvm)


#We can also compute the AIC and BIC of each model
log_likelihood <- sum(y * log(predictions_1) + (1 - y) * log(1 - predictions_1))
log_likelihood <- sum(y * log(predictions_3) + (1 - y) * log(1 - predictions_3))

# Get the number of non-zero coefficients (excluding the intercept)
d_1<- sum(coef(cv_fit_1, s = "lambda.min") != 0) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude intercept
d_3<- sum(coef(cv_fit_3, s = "lambda.min") != 0) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude intercept

# Number of observations
n <- length(y)

# Calculate AIC and BIC 
# LASSO
aic_1 <- -2 * log_likelihood + 2 * d_1
bic_1 <- -2 * log_likelihood + log(n) * d_1
#MIX 
aic_3 <- -2 * log_likelihood + 2 * d_3
bic_3<- -2 * log_likelihood + log(n) * d_3

# Print results
cat("Lasso Error:", lasso_error, "\n")
#cat("Ridge Error:", ridge_r_error, "\n")
cat("Elastic Net Error:", mix_error, "\n")


cat("Lasso AIC:", aic_1, "\n")
cat("Lasso BIC:", bic_1, "\n")
cat("Mix AIC:", aic_3, "\n")
cat("Mix BIC:", bic_3, "\n")
```
This Lasso is the minimum error indicates the best achievable prediction accuracy (under cross-validation) with the Lasso model using the optimal lambda that minimizes error. The model with the lower cross-validated error is typically the better choice for prediction, as it suggests better performance on unseen data.

AIC and BIC are metrics that balance model fit and complexity. Both penalize models with more parameters, with BIC generally penalizing complexity more strongly than AIC.

Clearly LASSO is the optimal model on our dataset as it has the lowest aic, bic and test error.

# I had to change the data bc I was getting the following error:
# Error: from glmnet C++ code (error code 7777); All used predictors have zero variance


# Preprocess to remove constant features
non_constant_columns <- apply(sparse_data, 2, function(col) var(col) > 0)
sparse_data <- sparse_data[, non_constant_columns]

# Step 2: Define your target variable
y <- as.factor(data[, 1])  # Convert target variable to a factor if binary
y_bin <- ifelse(y == -1, 0, 1)

# Initialize variables
n_features <- ncol(sparse_data)
selected_features <- 3  # Starting with X2
remaining_features <- setdiff(1:n_features, selected_features)

# Forward stepwise selection
for (step in 1:2) {
  best_score <- -Inf
  best_feature <- NULL
  
  for (feature in remaining_features) {
    current_features <- c(selected_features, feature)
    x_subset <- sparse_data[, current_features, drop = FALSE]
    
    # Skip iteration if x_subset contains constant features
    if (any(apply(x_subset, 2, var) == 0)) next
    
    # Fit the model
    model <- cv.glmnet(
      x = x_subset,
      y = y_bin,
      family = "binomial",
      alpha = 1,
      nfolds = 5
    )
    
    # Evaluate performance
    score <- max(model$cvm)
    if (score > best_score) {
      best_score <- score
      best_feature <- feature
    }
  }
  
  # Add the best feature
  if (!is.null(best_feature)) {
    selected_features <- c(selected_features, best_feature)
    remaining_features <- setdiff(remaining_features, best_feature)
    cat("Step", step, "- Selected feature:", best_feature, "Score:", best_score, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("No valid features to add at step", step, "\n")
    break
  }
}

# Step 6: Final model with selected features
final_features <- selected_features
final_model <- glmnet(
  x = sparse_data[, final_features, drop = FALSE],
  y = y_bin,
  family = "binomial",
  alpha = 1
)

# Summary of selected features
print(final_features)


```
