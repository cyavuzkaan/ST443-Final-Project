## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data <- read.csv("data2.csv.gz")

Binding: Indicates that the compound interacts or attaches effectively to the thrombin target site.
Non-binding: Indicates that the compound does not interact effectively with thrombin.
In the context of drug discovery, thrombin is a protein that could be a target for drugs aimed at affecting blood clotting, and identifying compounds that bind to thrombin can be a critical step in developing new medications.

```{r}

# Count NA values for each column
na_counts <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Print the result
totalna <- sum(na_counts)
# print(totalna) #printed 0 so data is clean

table(data[, 1])

```
```{r}
# summary data[, 2:100001]) will output too much data
# Filter rows where the compound binds to the target (binding status = 1)
binding_data <- data[data[, 1] == 1, ]

# Apply summary to the binding rows, excluding the first column (target variable)
# summary(binding_data[, -1])
# head(binding_data)
